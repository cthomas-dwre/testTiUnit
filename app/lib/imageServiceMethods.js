/**
 * lib/imageServiceMethods.js - image service mixin methods
 * The mixinImageServiceMethods will dynamically add image accessor methods to the supplied
 * object's prototype object. If you want to add your own image service then you must expose
 * the following methods that should ideally be added to the supplied oject's prototype:
 *
 *   getCartImage = function()
 *   getProductTileImage = function()
 *   getHeroImage = function(variationValue)
 *   getCategoryTileImage = function()
 *   getImageSwatchLink = function()
 *   getAltImages = function(variationValue)
 *   getAltZoomImages = function(variationValue)
 *   getLargeAltZoomImages = function(variationValue)
 *   getBundleProductImages = function(variationValue)
 *   getSetProductImages = function(attribute)
 *   getSwatchImages = function(variationValue)
 *
 * The functions above are the public interface to the rest of the application. You should only
 * ever mixin these functions into a prototype that needs to implement an image service.
 *
 * Note that some objects that have the above methods mixed have properties like 'image_swatch'
 * which is why the methods above are named as they are, for example getImageSwatchLink(). In order
 * to avoid clashing with the ocapi_methods mixins we have given these method unique names which
 * will not clash with methods that already exist on model objects or methods that are mixed in
 * by ocapi_methods.
